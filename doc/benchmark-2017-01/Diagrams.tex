\title{A Performance Comparison of General Purpose Multi-Dimensional In-Memory Indexes -- All Results}
\subtitle{Revision 1.2 -- 26th February 2018}


%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and

\section{Test Data}
\label{sec:data}


The OSM-P (points) and OSM-R (rectangles) datasets are extracts from OpenStreetMap.org representing the European Alps\footnote{\url{http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/alps.html}}, extracted on 2016-11-09 %. It ranges from Vienna in the north east to almost Grenoble in the south west, thus including major point clusters (cities) such as Vienna, Munich and Zurich 
(Fig.~\ref{fig:DSosmAlps}). The dataset consists of $\approx 2.1 \times 10^8$ points.
%=215,981,638 points.
% and extends from about min/max longitude=3.931094/20.2583918  latitude=37.7126446/49.1369103
%Points are imported in the order they have in the original OSM file, which appears to be the order in which they were recorded. That means that using a bigger part of the dataset increases mostly the \emph{density} of points, not the spatial extent of the dataset.
The rectangles (OSM-R) are bounding boxes for all line segments in the dataset.

The synthetic CU-P/CU-R datasets (Fig.~\ref{fig:DScube}), have the shape of a cube filled with up to 50,000,000 elements that are distributed uniformly at random between 0.0 and 1.0 in every dimension. Each element has unique coordinates.

The synthetic CL-P/CL-R datasets (Fig.~\ref{fig:DScluster}) consists of 1000 clusters that are distributed uniformly at random between 0.0 and 1.0. In each cluster, elements follow a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation $\sigma = 0.001$.
The CLUSTER dataset contains up to 50,000,000 elements. 
%An illustration of the CLUSTER dataset is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:DScluster}. 

%All points are generated randomly, however all tests use the same sets of randomly generated data.

%\subsection{Rectangle Data}
%The rectangle datasets are constructed in a similar way as the point datasets. 
%For the OSM Alps dataset, we created rectangles as bounding boxes for all line segments in the dataset.
%For the synthetic datasets, each data point becomes a rectangle with randomly generated edge length. Edge lengths vary between 0.0 and $10^{-5}$.
%For CUBE datasets, this results in little to no overlap. CLUSTER data is much denser and therefore likely to overlap. We decided to keep the edge length constant with increasing dimensionality, this means that the probability of overlapping decreases with increasing dimensionality $d$.
%All rectangles are axis-aligned rectangles defined by a 'lower left' and an 'upper right' corner point.


%\todo{Give details to shape and overlap of rectangles}
%
%We also generated an overlap dataset. The idea is to keep the number of pairwise overlaps $o$ as a relative fraction $r$ of the number of elements $N$ with $r=o/N$. For example, assuming a constant $r=0.5$, a dataset with $N=10^6$ rectangles will have about $o=500,000$ pairwise overlaps.
%
%To achieve constant $r$ for datasets with varying size and dimensionality, we vary the average side length $l_{avg} = 1/2*l_{max}$ of the rectangles as follows.
%
%\begin{equation}
		%r = 0.373 k N (l_{avg})^k 2^k \\
		%\Rightarrow \\
		%%\frac{r}{0.373 k N 2^k} = l_{avg}^k \\
		%%\Rightarrow \\
		%(\frac{r}{0.373 k N 2^k})^{1/k} = l_{avg} \\
%\end{equation}
%
%The equation has been developed empirically based on 120 experiments with $100 \leq N \leq 10^6$, $1 \leq k \leq 10$ and $10^{-8} \leq l_{max} \leq 0.8$ for a rectangle cloud between $[0..1]$ in all dimensions. This results ranged between $10^{-6} \leq r \leq 10^3$ ($0 \leq o \leq 2*10^8$). For all our experiments we chose $r=0.5$.

%\subsection{Conventions}
%
%For all diagrams, OSM Alps is abbreviated to OSM, CUBE to CU and CLUSTER to CL. The postfix `-P' indicates point data and `-R' indicates rectangle data. The size of the dataset is denoted by $N$ and the dimensionality by $d$. For all data, we use 64bit floating point values and we ensured that all data points have unique coordinates.



%\section{Outlook}
%\label{sec:outlook}
%
%\subsection{Optimisations}
%
%Numerous optimisations were \emph{not} done, for example:
%
%\begin{itemize}
	%\item Rebalancing for KD-Trees. However a preliminary test indicated that the effect on performance would have been negligible.
	%\item Variation of page sizes of R*Trees and X-Trees. These are known to have strong impact on performance. However we choose very small page sizes as these seemed to result in best performance across all scenarios. Note that these page sizes would have been unrealistically small for a persistent index, resulting in a page size of less than 256 byte (for smaller dimensions).
	%\item The PH-tree performs generally better when used with a data preprocessor~\cite{phtreeRevisitedM}. This usually increases performance by 10\%-30\%, in rare cases by several orders of magnitude, see the 15D CLUSTER 0.5 dataset in~\cite{ZZN2014phtree}.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\begin{itemize}
	%\item Bitstreaming: This is mostly a memory optimisations. Earlier tests with 64bit alignment showed pretty much the same performance (reduced memory (v11) access is outweighted by reduced computation (v10)).
	%\item Object pooling: This certainly makes a difference for the PH-Tree. However, since the PH-Tree has to create key instance for every extraction (queries, etc) and for every element that is inserted (array resizing), the PH-Tree would be unfairly bad. Memory pooling is likely to have much less impact for other index structures.
%\end{itemize}



%\subsection{More Tests}
%
%\begin{itemize}
	%\item Vary overlap of rectangles
	%\item Vary query shapes
