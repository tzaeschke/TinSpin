# tinspin-hdf5

HDF5 file reader for the TinSpin project. 

The aim of this project is to provide a simple Java reader for [HDF5 files](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/) in order to extract coordinates for the TinSpin test framework. The aim is _not_ to provide a full fledged reader for all data associated with coordinates.

The main goal is to import [HDF5 v1 files](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html) as provided by the [erikbern/ann-benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks/blob/master/README.md) project.
